This fork of GPipe is to be compatible with newer libraries with changed interfaces:

 * base 4.7.0.0 (ghc 7.8), 
 * [OpenGL 2.9.2.1](https://github.com/Cedev/OpenGL) (a fork of OpenGL 2.9.2 that fixes types being too restrictive to use cube map textures)
 * boolean 0.1.0

It requires a [newer Vec-Boolean](https://github.com/plredmond/Vec-Boolean) than is currently on Hackage.
